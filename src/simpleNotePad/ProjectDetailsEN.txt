Project Idea: Simple Text-Based Note-Taking Application

Project Description: This project aims to create a simple text-based note-taking application
where users can create and edit text notes. Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and view text notes.

Project Requirements:

Users should be able to add notes. Each note should have a title and content.

Users should be able to edit notes.

Users should be able to delete notes.

Users should be able to view notes.

Notes should be stored in a list.

Provide menu options to the user (e.g., add a new note, edit a note, delete a note, view a note).

Technical Requirements:

You will need to develop the application using the Java programming language.

You can use a data structure like an ArrayList to store notes.

You can create a user interface (UI) using either a basic console interface or a GUI
 (such as Swing or JavaFX). A console-based application may be simpler for a start.

Create an account on GitHub or another code-sharing platform to manage and share your project.

Implement version control by regularly uploading your project to GitHub.

Getting Started:

Review basic data structures and classes in Java.

Research user input and creating a console interface (you can use the Scanner class to get input from users).

Plan how you will store and manage notes.

Develop the project step by step and upload it to GitHub.

As you progress, look for opportunities to customize or enhance the project
 (e.g., adding timestamps to notes, storing notes in files, or adding a different user interface).
